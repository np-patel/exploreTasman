## Explore Tasman

Explore Tasman is an web app that enables close networking between visitors and staff of "Abel Tasman, National Park"- An all around "park organizer". Essentially turns your device into a social+services. Through this web app Tasman staff can provide visitors a responsible, informative and caring service. there isn't much information for the visitors to access while they are at the park so through this web app, visitors can interact with each others as well as stay connected with the Abel Tasman staff. 

It is built using Laravel Framework and bootstrap, I have also used latest technologies such as Ajax, Sass and Json to create the core functionalities of the website. Some of the functionalities of the website are user can post status, comments and upload image to the google map. There is also an admin area where admin can put informative stuff for the users and has access to block uninformative stuff.
